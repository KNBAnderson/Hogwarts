  <div id="beforeSorting">
    <h3>At Hogwarts we have four houses. You will be sorted about one of these.</h3>
    <h4>Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, <br>
      But don’t judge on what you see, <br>
      I’ll eat myself if you can find <br>
      A smarter hat than me. <br>
      You can keep your bowlers black, <br>
      Your top hats sleek and tall, <br>
      For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat <br>
      And I can cap them all. <br>
      There’s nothing hidden in your head <br>
      The Sorting Hat can’t see, <br>
      So try me on and I will tell you <br>
      Where you ought to be. <br>
      You might belong in Gryffindor, <br>
      Where dwell the brave at heart, <br>
      Their daring, nerve and chivalry <br>
      Set Gryffindors apart; <br>
      You might belong in Hufflepuff, <br>
      Where they are just and loyal, <br>
      Those patient Hufflepuffs are true <br>
      And unafraid of toil; <br>
      Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, <br>
      If you’ve a ready mind, <br>
      Where those of wit and learning, <br>
      Will always find their kind; <br>
      Or perhaps in Slytherin <br>
      You’ll make your real friends, <br>
      Those cunning folk use any means <br>
      To achieve their ends. <br>
      So put me on! Don’t be afraid! <br>
      And don’t get in a flap! <br>
      You’re in safe hands (though I have none) <br>
      For I’m a Thinking Cap! -Sorting Hat</h4>

        Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, <br>
        Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, <br>
        One among us seven will let you move ahead, <br>
        Another will transport the drinker back instead, <br>
        Two among our number hold only nettle wine, <br>
        Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. <br>
        Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, <br>
        To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: <br>
        First, however slyly the poison tries to hide <br>
        You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; <br>
        Second, different are those who stand at either end, <br>
        But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; <br>
        Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, <br>
        Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; <br>
        Fourth, the second left and the second on the right <br>
        Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. <br>
